- Integration over images not over buckets. This way the render is progressive. 
- sampling is done using const seed - rendring the same scene will result with the same images.

- camera initialized with NOT perpendicular up and forward vectors!! - wrong rays directions were cast
- camera: getray rewritten.  

- CMmakeLists.txt -> headers included in ${sources} variable, only this way QtCreator shows headers in a project.  
- math/Frame.h added. Coordinate frames support - changes of coordiantes between two basis. 
- pi constants added to numeric.h for portability.
- Materials rewritten, now inluding sample_brdf and get_pdf functions, eval_brdf is in local coordinates in tangent space.
